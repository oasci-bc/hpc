# Authentication

SSH authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client attempting to connect to a remote server using the SSH protocol.
The purpose of authentication is to ensure that only authorized users can access the server and its resources, preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

SSH authentication is crucial in HPC environments, where multiple users share valuable computing resources and sensitive data.
By implementing secure authentication methods, HPC administrators can control access to the systems, protect user accounts, and maintain the integrity of the computing infrastructure.

SSH supports several authentication methods, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.
The two most common authentication methods are password-based authentication and key-based authentication.
